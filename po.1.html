<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Patchouli is a
tool for easily creating and maintaining a set of source
code patches, while continuing to normally edit, compile,
and do version control of the project as one whole.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The basic idea
behind <b>Patchouli</b> is that as the source code is
modified, the programmer annotates each modification as
belonging to a certain patch (see SOURCE CODE ANNOTATIONS
below). The programmer can continue to normally view, edit,
compile, and run the source code with its embedded annotated
modifications. Additionally, the programmer specifies the
order of these annotations and can describe them (see
CONFIGURATION FILE below).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Then at any
point, the entire patch set can be created automatically
from these annotations, by running the <b>po</b> tool
described in this manual.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Patchouli is
especially useful in projects where maintainers expect big
changes to be broken down to many small patches, each easier
to explain and to review. The programmer would still like to
work on the source code as a whole (and not on individual
patches), and to be able to easily regenerate the patch set
if they need to be resubmitted (e.g., after comments from
the maintainer, changes to the base project, and so on).</p>

<h2>SOURCE CODE ANNOTATIONS
<a name="SOURCE CODE ANNOTATIONS"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">As explained
above, Patchouli uses <i>annotations</i> inserted in the
source code which mark modifications, and say which
modification belongs to which patch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The annotations
not only mark the modifications, they also need to ensure
that the code can be compiled as if all the patches have
been applied to it. I.e., lines that are marked as added
need to be compiled in, while lines that are marked as
deleted need to be ignored. The annotations format shown
below indeed satisfies this requirement.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Patchouli
currently supports annotations using C preprocessor
directives. These are useful for C and C++ language code.
The following annotations are supported. In the code
examples below, ordinary text is pre-modification code,
while the bold text is the new source-code lines and their
annotation. <br>
Add lines (in patch named &quot;comment&quot;):</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">int square(int
n){ <b><br>
#if 1 /* patchouli comment */ <br>
/* square n */ <br>
#endif</b> <br>
return n*n; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Delete lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">int triple(int
n){ <b><br>
#if 0 /* patchouli remove printouts */ <br>
printf(&quot;tripling %d0, n); <br>
#endif</b> <br>
return 3*n; <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Replace lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">One can replace
lines with two separate annotations, marking the deletion of
the old lines and then marking the new lines, but a more
compact (and natural) representation is available:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">int square(int
n){ <b><br>
#if 1 /* patchouli algorithm */ <br>
return n*n; <br>
#else</b> <br>
return 2*n; <b><br>
#endif</b> <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Or,
alternatively,</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">int square(int
n){ <b><br>
#if 0 /* patchouli algorithm */</b> <br>
return 2*n; <b><br>
#else <br>
return n*n; <br>
#endif</b> <br>
}</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Undone modifications:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">In some cases,
it is necessary for one patch to make modifications which
are later undone (or further modified) by a second patch.
This is needed if, for example, the program needs to compile
after each individual patch is applied. Such transient
modifications can be specified using <i>nested</i>
annotations:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#if 0 /*
patchouli patch2 */ <br>
#if 1 /* patchouli patch1 */ <br>
/* this code is added in patch1, but removed again in patch2
*/ <br>
#endif <br>
#endif</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note how the
outer annotation describes the later modification: The the
line is removed in patch2 and therefore doesn&rsquo;t exist
in the final patched code, so the outer &quot;#if 0&quot;
makes sure it isn&rsquo;t compiled.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">As another
example, the following annotations replace the function name
&quot;try1&quot; in the original code with &quot;try2&quot;
in the first patch, and then again renames it to
&quot;try3&quot; in the second patch:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#if 0 /*
patchouli second */ <br>
#if 0 /* patchouli first */</b> <br>
int try1(){ <b><br>
#else <br>
int try2(){ <br>
#endif <br>
#else <br>
int try3(){ <br>
#endif</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Nested modifications:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Another use for
nested annotations is a shortcut for adding new lines in the
middle of a block of lines already added by a previous
modification. For example, consider we already have a patch
adding two lines:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#if 1 /*
patchouli patch1 */ <br>
line1 <br>
line2 <br>
#endif</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">And now we want
to create a second patch, patch2, which adds a new line
between these &quot;line1&quot; and &quot;line2&quot;. The
long way is to split up the original annotation:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#if 1 /*
patchouli patch1 */ <br>
line1 <br>
#endif <br>
#if 1 /* patchouli patch2 */ <br>
added in the middle <br>
#endif <br>
#if 1 /* patchouli patch1 */ <br>
line2 <br>
#endif</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">We can use
nested annotations for a shorter and perhaps more readable
description of the same change:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>#if 1 /*
patchouli patch1 */ <br>
line1 <br>
#if 1 /* patchouli patch2 */ <br>
added in the middle <br>
#endif <br>
line2 <br>
#endif</b></p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Note that
currently, <b>po</b> is limited only to a single level of
annotation nesting (i.e., the above examples are supported,
but deeper level of nesting isn&rsquo;t).</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%;">Modifying C preprocessor
directives:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Above we showed
the usual way of annotating changes, using C preprocessor
directives. Unfortunately, if the change we&rsquo;re trying
to annotate is a single #if, #else, #elif or #endif, we
can&rsquo;t annotate it with our usual annotations. As an
example, consider the following ill-attempt to add an
&quot;#else&quot; to an existing #if:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">#if something
<br>
dosomething; <b><br>
#if 1 /* patchouli patch */ <br>
#else <br>
somethingelse; <br>
#endif</b> <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">This is wring,
because when the compiler reads this code, it wrongly treats
the &quot;#else&quot; as referring to the Patchouli
annotation, not the &quot;#if something&quot; it was
supposed to refer to.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Therefore, for
this use-case we have an alternative annotation method,
which uses a comment at the end of the line which marks its
addition in some patch. The following is the right way to do
what we tried to do above:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">#if something
<br>
dosomething; <b><br>
#else/***patchouli patch***/ <br>
#if 1 /* patchouli patch */ <br>
somethingelse; <br>
#endif</b> <br>
#endif</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The patch names
used in these annotations can be chosen arbitrarily, but
they need to be also listed in the <b>PATCHOULI</b>
configuration file, as described in the next section. Patch
names may include any characters except slash
(&quot;/&quot;), newline or null.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In particular,
patch names with spaces in them are fine. However, please
note that leading or trailing spaces in the patch names are
not considered part of the patch name, and are ignored, and
in general extraneous white space in annotation lines are
ignored. For example, the following lines, with
&quot;_&quot; representing a space, all fine, and behave
identically:</p>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">#if_1_/*_patchouli_name_*/
<br>
#if_1_/*__patchouli_name_*/ <br>
#if_1_/*_patchouli_name__*/ <br>
#if_1_/*_patchouli__name_*/ <br>
#if_1_/*patchouli_name*/ <br>
#if_1/*_patchouli_name_*/</p>

<h2>CONFIGURATION FILE
<a name="CONFIGURATION FILE"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The source code
annotations described above determine which modification
goes into which patch file, but to actually create these
patch files, the <b>po</b> tool needs additional
information, which should be written in a file called
&quot;<b>PATCHOULI</b>&quot; in the top directory of the
project, where <b>po</b> will be run.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">This section
lists the various configuration commands available.
Specifying at least one <b>patch</b> and at least one
<b>file</b> is mandatory,</p>

<table width="100%" border="0" rules="none" frame="void"
       cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr valign="top" align="left">
<td width="11%"></td>
<td width="7%">


<p><b>patch</b></p></td>
<td width="4%"></td>
<td width="78%">


<p>po needs to know the <i>order</i> of the patches,
because patch files refer to specific line numbers and to
specific contexts, so the order in which they will be
applied matters.</p></td></tr>
</table>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">The order of
the <b>patch</b> commands in the PATCHOULI file determines
the patch order. Each command specifies a patch name (the
name used in the annotations), a one-line description of the
patch and an optional long description. The descriptions are
used when creating the patch files - the one-line
description is used as the subject of the patch file
(assuming it will be mailed), and the long description is
put after the subject line, and before the actual content of
the patch.</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">A <b>patch</b>
command is formatted like this:</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em"><b>patch</b>
name: short description <br>
first line of long description <br>
second line of long description</p>

<p style="margin-left:22%; margin-top: 1em">Each line in
the long description must start with a whitespace, because
the next line not starting with a whitespace is considered
to start a new configuration command. In particular, even a
blank line in the long description needs to be a line with a
single white space, otherwise it is considered to end the
descption.</p>
